# Diploma Thesis
***Interactive software laboratory for exploring L-systems by secondary school students***

## Annotation
Within this diploma master thesis, a software laboratory (interface for learning) will be designed, developed and tested for the secondary level students for interactive explorations of different types of Lindenmayer rewriting systems. Students will get an opportunity to interactively build simple and more complex deterministic and nondeterministic OL-systems which can be visualised by the turtle geometry paradigm in an appealing and inspiring way. Students can explore some rather complex CS concepts in a developmentally appropriate way already at the secondary level. The thesis will focus on (a) interactive symbolic interface for defining axiom and rewriting rules with or without branching, (b) building an interpreter for generating derivations, and (c) immediate visualisation of the generated strings with multiple options for parametrisation by different kinds of perturbation. In this laboratory, secondary students may explore complex concepts of CS like rules, rewriting systems, derivation, deterministic system, nondeterministic system etc. due to attractive visualisations which can be used to model plants.
